## 1. Installation

The code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with 1 Nvidia Tesla V100S-PCIE-32GB GPU.

1. Install [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and create a `Conda` environment.

   ```shell
   conda create --name vasija python=3.11
   conda activate vasija
   ```

## 2. Visualize Dataset

1. After downloading the data, you can visualize it by running the following command.

   ```shell
   python utils/visualize.py
   ```

   Then you need to type in the path to the data file you want to visualize.

## 3. Training

1. To train the model, run the following command.

   ```shell
   python training_GAN32.py
   python training_GAN64.py
   ```

   The first command will train the model on 32x32x32 voxel data, and the second command will train the model on 64x64x64 voxel data. The 32 resolution will take about ..., and the 64 resolution will take about ...

## 4. Testing

1. To test the model, run the following command.
   ```shell
   python test_visualize.py
   ```
   The command will random select a sample file from test dataset and visualize the generated result and the ground truth.
